#### Application

1 The living hope to which they were born again is something they rejoiced in
  * _Being born again is to an inheritance that is eternal_
    * Are you born again?
    * Do you look forward to the return of Christ when you will see Him face to face?
    * Do you rejoice in this living hope?

2 They were tested by trials so that their faith could bring praise honor and glory to Christ
  * _This is at the revelation of Christ, the theme of this book being a future hope it is significant that he points to Christ's return_
    * When your faith is tested by trials it can bring praise honor and glory to Him
    * Do we consider trials bad rather then good?


3 Those who have faith in Christ, believe, love, and rejoice in Christ even though they do not see Him
  * _Rejoicing starts now, because of belief that Christ will return and we will see Him_
    * Do we have inexpressible joy in Christ?
    * Do we believe and love Him even though we do not see?
