#### Application

Conclusion of the matter 
  Titus 2:11-14
    The grace of God does teach us to live godly lives, it is in light of the coming hope! It is He that purifies us.
  2 Peter 3
    Peter speaks of the reason for his epistles, that he would stir up by way of reminder the things pertaining to the coming of Christ
  Acts 24:14-16
    Paul because of hope in God, strives

We are pilgrims because we look to another homeland - Heb 11:13-16
  These all died in faith looking to the promises, pilgrims because rather then looking to the their country they desired a heavenly country!

We rejoice in our living hope and bring glory to Christ
They had not and did not see Christ, but they rejoiced! For they knew that when He is revealed we shall be made like Him! We will see Him face to face!
1Co 13:12, 15:50, 2Co 3:18


It is not simply us being told to live holy
It is not to exhort us to grit our teeth and be like Jesus was in suffering
But to look to Him, our living hope! We must remember the purpose of the scripture story of redemption! It has never changed, from before and of old they looked to the coming of the Christ and now that He is revealed we look to His coming again.
Submission is not suffering, it is beautiful, incorruptible and precious in the sight of God!

Flee the wrath to come, flee to Jesus, just as in the days of Noah some were saved by entering the ark, so must we enter into Christ to excape the coming judgment.

1 The living hope to which they were born again is something they rejoiced in
  * _Being born again is to an inheritance that is eternal_
    * Are you born again?
    * Do you look forward to the return of Christ when you will see Him face to face?
    * Do you rejoice in this living hope?

2 They were tested by trials so that their faith could bring praise honor and glory to Christ
  * _This is at the revelation of Christ, the theme of this book being a future hope it is significant that he points to Christ's return_
    * When your faith is tested by trials it can bring praise honor and glory to Him
    * Do we consider trials bad rather then good?


3 Those who have faith in Christ, believe, love, and rejoice in Christ even though they do not see Him
  * _Rejoicing starts now, because of belief that Christ will return and we will see Him_
    * Do we have inexpressible joy in Christ?
    * Do we believe and love Him even though we do not see?
