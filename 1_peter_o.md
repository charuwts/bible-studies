## 1 Peter Observations

* The book was written not long after Paul's death
  * likely around the time of Nero - 64

### 1:1

* The book is from the Apostle Peter
  * it is likely Peter used an amanuensis - _5:12_
    * it has been argued that 5:12 could only be referring to Silvanus as the deliverer of the epistle
* Peter was the apostle to the Jews - _Galatians 2:7-8_
* Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia were among the regions spoken to at Pentecost - _Acts 2:9_
  * Aquila was born in Pontus - _Acts 18:2_
* Paul was withheld from going to Asia and Bithynia after going through the region of Galatia - _Acts 16:6-7_
  * The regions were reached directly or indirectly via the ministry of Paul
* Asia is made up of Jews and Greeks - _Acts 9:10_
  * The gospel spread throughout Asia while Paul reasoned daily in the school of Tyrannus
    * This could be the result of people coming to him or believer's going out from there or both
* The regions being written to consisted of Gentiles and Jews
* Everyone in Asia turned away from Paul - _2 Timothy 1:15_

### 1:2

### 1:7

* Faith is more precious then gold
* both faith and gold are tested by fire
* the purpose of their trials was to prove the genuiness of their faith

      * this is a future event

### 1:8

* the pilgrims had not previously or currently seen Jesus
