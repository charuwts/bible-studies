## 1 Peter Observations

* The book was written not long after Paul's death
  * likely around the time of Nero - 64

### 1:1

* The book is from the Apostle Peter
  * it is likely Peter used an amanuensis - _5:12_
    * it has been argued that 5:12 could only be referring to Silvanus as the deliverer of the epistle
* Peter was the apostle to the Jews - _Galatians 2:7-8_
* Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia were among the regions spoken to at Pentecost - _Acts 2:9_
  * Aquila was born in Pontus - _Acts 18:2_
* Paul was withheld from going to Asia and Bithynia after going through the region of Galatia - _Acts 16:6-7_
  * The regions were reached directly or indirectly via the ministry of Paul
* Asia is made up of Jews and Greeks - _Acts 9:10_
  * The gospel spread throughout Asia while Paul reasoned daily in the school of Tyrannus
    * This could be the result of people coming to him or believer's going out from there or both
* The regions being written to consisted of Gentiles and Jews
* Everyone in Asia turned away from Paul - _2 Timothy 1:15_

### 1:2

* the elect God knew of beforehand
* peace can be multiplied

### 1:3

* access to living hope is through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
* Peter includes himself as having the living hope via the pronouns "our" and "us"

### 1:4 

* there is an inheritance reserved in heaven
  * it is incorruptible
  * it is undefiled
  * does not fade away
  * it is for the elect

### 1:5

* they are kept for salvation
  * through faith
  * by the power of God
* salvation will be revealed in the last time

### 1:6

* they greatly rejoice in this living hope
* they rejoice even in trials because of this hope
* the trials are for a little while
* there is a possibility they are not needed
* the trials grieve them

### 1:7

* Faith is more precious then gold
* both faith and gold are tested by fire
* the purpose of their trials was to prove the genuiness of their faith 
  * and thus bring praise, honor and glory to Jesus
    * when Jesus Christ returns
      * this is a future event

### 1:8

* the pilgrims had not previously or currently seen Jesus
  * yet they love
  * yet they believe
    * and so rejoice
* past tense "not seen", yet they love
* present tense "do not see", yet they believe
* Their joy is inexpressible
* Their joy is full of glory


### 1:9

* The outcome of faith is salvation
  * The salvation of their souls

### 1:10

* The prophets searched and inquired about this salvation
  * specifically seeking to know the person or time of what was predicted by the spirit - _1:11_
* The prophets prophesied of grace that would come

### 1:11

* The spirit of Christ was in the prophets
* the spirit testified of Christ beforehand
  * of his suffering 
  * and of glories to follow
  * The prophets did not know when these things would take place

### 1:12

* Peter again refers to "us" instead of "you"
  * NASB uses the word "you"
* the gospel was preached by the Holy Spirit
  * The Spirit was sent from heaven
* Angels desire to look into these things
  * see also Ephesians 3:12 and 1 Corinthians 11:10

### 1:13

* NKJV be sober / NASB be sober _in spirit_
* their hope should be fixed to something
  * on the grace to be brought to them
    * it will be brought at the revelation of Jesus Christ

### 1:14-16

* They had former lusts
  * they were theirs in their ignorance
  * they are not to be conformed to them
    * being former and commanded not to conform to them implies they can go back to them
* in contrast to lust, they are to be holy
  * like the One who called them
  * they are to be so in all behavior/conduct
  * the reason is because it is written to be so - _Leviticus 11:44-5_

### 1:17

* the Father judges according to works
  * if they call on Him they ought to fear
    * during time on earth

### 1:18-19

* they were redeemed with blood
  * not with silver and gold
* their previous way of life was futile/aimless
*  

### 1:20

* Jesus was foreknown
* Jesus appeared in the last times
  * the last times are at hand
  * He appeared for their sake

### 1:21

* God raised Christ from the dead
  * and gave Him glory
  * it was for the purpose that their faith and hope would be in God

### 1:22

* they have purified their souls in obeying the truth
* Peter commands them to love one another
  * This is done even though they have been purified for this purpose
  * he says to do so fervantly

### 1:23




### 2:4

* Jesus was rejected by men
* Jesus is chosen and precious to God

### 2:5

* They are living stones
  * being built up
    * a spiritual house
    * a holy priesthood
* They can offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God
  * Through Jesus Christ
  * This is the reason they are being built up

### 2:6-8
* This is also contained in the scripture Isaiah 28:16
* Whoever believes on this chief cornerstone, will by no means be put to shame
  * Therefore He is precious to those who believe
  * To those who are disobedient He has become a stone of stumbling

### 2:9

* There is a list of descriptors for the chosen of God
* They are His own special people for the purpose that they may proclaim the praises of Him
* There is a contrast of them being called out of darkness to light
