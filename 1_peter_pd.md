>>> __6__ In this you greatly rejoice,
>>>> though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,

>>>>>> at the revelation of Jesus Christ,
>>>>>>> __8__ whom having not seen you love. 
>>>>>>>> Though now you do not see Him, yet believing,
>>>>>>>>> you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,
  > __9__ receiving the end of your faith— the salvation of your souls.
    > __10__ Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, 
      > who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,
      > __11__ searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand
        > the sufferings of Christ 
        > and the glories that would follow.
      > __12__ To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you
        > through those who have preached the gospel to you
        > by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things which angels desire to look into.
    > __13__ Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, 
    > be sober, 
    > and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
      > __14__ as obedient children,
        > not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance;
        > __15__ but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,
          > __16__ because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.”
    > __17__ And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work,
      > conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear;
        > __18__ knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, 
          > from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers,
        > __19__ but with the precious blood of Christ, 
          > as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
            > __20__ He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, 
              > but was manifest in these last times for you
                > __21__ who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, 
                  > so that your faith and hope are in God.
> __22__ Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, 
  > love one another fervently with a pure heart,
    > __23__ having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, 
      > through the word of God which lives and abides forever,
        > __24__ because “All flesh is as grass, 
        > And all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. 
        > The grass withers, 
        > And its flower falls away, 
        > __25__ But the word of the Lord endures forever.”
> Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.
  > __CH2__ Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, 
  > __2__ as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby,
    > __3__ if indeed you have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious.
    > __4__ Coming to Him [as to] a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God [and] precious,
      > __5__ you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, 
        > to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
      > __6__ Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion A chief cornerstone, elect, precious, And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame."
        > __7__ Therefore, to you who believe, [He is] precious; but to those who are disobedient, "The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,"
        > __8__ and "A stone of stumbling And a rock of offense." 
          > They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed.
          > __9__ But you [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, 
            > that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
            > __10__ who once [were] not a people but [are] now the people of God, 
            > who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy.
> __11__ Beloved, I beg [you] as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,
  > __12__ having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, 
    > that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by [your] good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.
      > __13__ Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme, __14__ or to governors, 
        > as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers 
        > and [for the] praise of those who do good.
  > __15__ For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men-- __16__ as free, 
    > yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, 
    > but as bondservants of God.
> __17__ Honor all [people]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
> __18__ Servants, [be] submissive to [your] masters with all fear, 
  > not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh.
    > __19__ For this [is] commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully.
    > __20__ For what credit [is it] if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? 
    > But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this [is] commendable before God.
  > __21__ For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:
    > __22__ "Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth";
    > __23__ who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; 
    > when He suffered, He did not threaten, 
    > but committed [Himself] to Him who judges righteously;
> __24__ who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, 
  > might live for righteousness--
  > by whose stripes you were healed.
  > __25__ For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

> __CH3__ Wives, likewise, [be] submissive to your own husbands, 
  > that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives,
    > __2__ when they observe your chaste conduct [accompanied] by fear.
  > __3__ Do not let your adornment be [merely] outward--
    > arranging the hair, 
    > wearing gold, 
    > or putting on [fine] apparel--
  > __4__ rather [let it be] the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible [beauty] of a gentle and quiet spirit, 
    > which is very precious in the sight of God.
    > __5__ For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, 
      > being submissive to their own husbands,
      > __6__ as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, 
        > whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.
> __7__ Husbands, likewise, dwell with [them] with understanding, 
  > giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as [being] heirs together of the grace of life,
    > that your prayers may not be hindered.
> __8__ Finally, all [of you be] of one mind, 
  > having compassion for one another; 
  > love as brothers, 
  > [be] tenderhearted, 
  > [be] courteous;
  > __9__ not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, 
    > but on the contrary blessing, 
      > knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing.
> __10__ For "He who would love life And see good days, 
  > Let him refrain his tongue from evil, 
  > And his lips from speaking deceit.
  > __11__ Let him turn away from evil and do good; 
  > Let him seek peace and pursue it.
    > __12__ For the eyes of the LORD [are] on the righteous, And His ears [are open] to their prayers; 
    > But the face of the LORD [is] against those who do evil."
  > __13__ And who [is] he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good?
  > __14__ But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, [you are] blessed. 
    > "And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled."
    > __15__ But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, 
    > and always [be] ready to [give] a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, 
      > with meekness and fear;
      > __16__ having a good conscience, 
      > that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.
> __17__ For [it is] better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
  > __18__ For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, 
    > that He might bring us to God, 
      > being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,
    > __19__ by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,
      > __20__ who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while [the] ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
      > __21__ There is also an antitype which now saves us--baptism 
        > (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, 
        > but the answer of a good conscience toward God), 
          > through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
          > __22__ who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.
> __CH4__ Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, 
  > for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
> __2__ that he no longer should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
> __3__ For we [have spent] enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles--when we walked in lewdness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.
> __4__ In regard to these, they think it strange that you do not run with [them] in the same flood of dissipation, speaking evil of [you].
> __5__ They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
> __6__ For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
> __7__ But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers.
> __8__ And above all things have fervent love for one another, for "love will cover a multitude of sins."
> __9__ [Be] hospitable to one another without grumbling.
> __10__ As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
> __11__ If anyone speaks, [let him speak] as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, [let him do it] as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
> __12__ Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you;
> __13__ but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ's sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.
> __14__ If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed [are you], for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified.
> __15__ But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters.
> __16__ Yet if [anyone suffers] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.
> __17__ For the time [has come] for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if [it begins] with us first, what will [be] the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?
> __18__ Now "If the righteous one is scarcely saved, Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
> __19__ Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls [to Him] in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.
> __CH5__ The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed:
> __2__ Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly;
> __3__ nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;
> __4__ and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.
> the humble."
> __6__ Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,
> __7__ casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.
> __8__ Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
> __9__ Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.
> __10__ But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle [you].
> __11__ To Him [be] the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
> __12__ By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
> __13__ She who is in Babylon, elect together with [you], greets you; and [so does] Mark my son.
> __14__ Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
