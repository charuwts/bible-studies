## 1 Peter Propositional Diagram

<pre>

<b>CH1</b> 
    Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
        To the pilgrims of the Dispersion 
            in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
<b>2</b> elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
    in sanctification of the Spirit,
        for obedience
            and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
<b>3</b> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope
        through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
        <b>4</b> to an inheritance incorruptible
            and undefiled
            and that does not fade away,
            reserved in heaven for you,
                <b>5</b> who are kept by the power of God 
                    through faith
                    for salvation 
                        ready to be revealed in the last time.
<b>6</b> In this you greatly rejoice,
    though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,
        <b>7</b> that the genuineness of your faith, 
                being much more precious than gold that perishes,
                though it is tested by fire,
                    may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,
                        <b>8</b> whom having not seen you love. 
                        Though now you do not see Him,
                            yet believing,
                            you rejoice with joy inexpressible
                            and full of glory,
                                <b>9</b> receiving the end of your faith— the salvation of your souls.
<b>10</b> Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, 
    who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,
        <b>11</b> searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand
            the sufferings of Christ 
            and the glories that would follow.
    <b>12</b> To them it was revealed that, 
        not to themselves, 
        but to us 
            they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you
                through those who have preached the gospel to you
                    by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—
                        things which angels desire to look into.
<b>13</b> Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, 
    be sober, 
    and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you
        at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
        <b>14</b> as obedient children,
            not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, 
                as in your ignorance;
                <b>15</b> but as He who called you is holy, 
                you also be holy in all your conduct,
                <b>16</b> because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.”
<b>17</b> And if you call on the Father, 
    who without partiality judges according to each one’s work,
    conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear;
        <b>18</b> knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, 
            like silver or gold, 
            from your aimless conduct 
                received by tradition 
                from your fathers,
            <b>19</b> but with the precious blood of Christ, 
                as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
                <b>20</b> He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, 
                    but was manifest in these last times for you
                    <b>21</b> who through Him believe in God, 
                        who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, 
                            so that your faith and hope are in God.
<b>22</b> Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth 
    through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, 
    love one another fervently with a pure heart,
        <b>23</b> having been born again, 
            not of corruptible seed 
            but incorruptible, 
                through the word of God which lives and abides forever,
                    <b>24</b> because “All flesh is as grass, 
                        And all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. 
                        The grass withers, 
                        And its flower falls away, 
                        <b>25</b> But the word of the Lord endures forever.”
Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.
    <b>CH2</b> Therefore, laying aside all malice, 
        all deceit, 
        hypocrisy, 
        envy, 
        and all evil speaking, 
    <b>2</b> as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, 
        that you may grow thereby,
        <b>3</b> if indeed you have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious.
<b>4</b> Coming to Him [as to] a living stone, 
    rejected indeed by men, 
    but chosen by God [and] precious,
    <b>5</b> you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, 
        a holy priesthood, 
            to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God 
                through Jesus Christ.
    <b>6</b> Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, 
        "Behold, I lay in Zion A chief cornerstone, 
            elect, 
            precious, 
            And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame."
        <b>7</b> Therefore, to you who believe, 
            [He is] precious; 
            but to those who are disobedient, 
                "The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,"
                <b>8</b> and "A stone of stumbling And a rock of offense." 
                    They stumble, being disobedient to the word, 
                          to which they also were appointed.
            <b>9</b> But you [are] a chosen generation, 
                a royal priesthood, 
                a holy nation, 
                His own special people, 
                    that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
                <b>10</b> who once [were] not a people 
                      but [are] now the people of God, 
                who had not obtained mercy 
                    but now have obtained mercy.
<b>11</b> Beloved, I beg [you] as sojourners and pilgrims, 
    abstain from fleshly lusts 
        which war against the soul,
    <b>12</b> having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, 
        that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.
        <b>13</b> Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, 
            whether to the king as supreme, 
            <b>14</b> or to governors, 
            as to those who are sent by him 
                for the punishment of evildoers 
                and [for the] praise of those who do good.
<b>15</b> For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men-- 
    <b>16</b> as free, 
        yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice,
        but as bondservants of God.
<b>17</b> Honor all [people]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
<b>18</b> Servants, [be] submissive to [your] masters with all fear, 
    not only to the good and gentle, 
    but also to the harsh.
    <b>19</b> For this [is] commendable, 
        if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully.
        <b>20</b> For what credit [is it] if, 
            when you are beaten for your faults, 
                you take it patiently? 
        But when you do good and suffer,
            if you take it patiently, 
            this [is] commendable before God.
<b>21</b> For to this you were called, 
    because Christ also suffered for us, 
        leaving us an example, 
        that you should follow His steps:
            <b>22</b> "Who committed no sin, 
            Nor was deceit found in His mouth";
            <b>23</b> who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; 
            when He suffered, He did not threaten, 
                but committed [Himself] to Him who judges righteously;
            <b>24</b> who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, 
                that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness--
                    by whose stripes you were healed.
        <b>25</b> For you were like sheep going astray, 
            but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

<b>CH3</b> Wives, likewise, [be] submissive to your own husbands, 
    that even if some do not obey the word, 
        they, without a word, 
        may be won by the conduct of their wives,
            <b>2</b> when they observe your chaste conduct [accompanied] by fear.
    <b>3</b> Do not let your adornment be [merely] outward--
        arranging the hair, 
        wearing gold, 
        or putting on [fine] apparel--
            <b>4</b> rather [let it be] the hidden person of the heart, 
                with the incorruptible [beauty] of a gentle and quiet spirit, 
                    which is very precious in the sight of God.
                    <b>5</b> For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, 
                        being submissive to their own husbands,
                            <b>6</b> as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord,
                                whose daughters you are 
                                    if you do good 
                                    and are not afraid with any terror.
<b>7</b> Husbands, likewise, dwell with [them] with understanding, 
    giving honor to the wife, 
        as to the weaker vessel, 
        and as [being] heirs together of the grace of life,
            that your prayers may not be hindered.
<b>8</b> Finally, all [of you be] of one mind, 
    having compassion for one another; 
        love as brothers, 
        [be] tenderhearted, 
        [be] courteous;
        <b>9</b> not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, 
        but on the contrary blessing, 
        knowing that you were called to this, 
            that you may inherit a blessing.
      <b>10</b> For "He who would love life And see good days, 
          Let him refrain his tongue from evil, 
          And his lips from speaking deceit.
          <b>11</b> Let him turn away from evil and do good; 
          Let him seek peace and pursue it.
              <b>12</b> For the eyes of the LORD [are] on the righteous, 
              And His ears [are open] to their prayers; 
              But the face of the LORD [is] against those who do evil."
              <b>13</b> And who [is] he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good?
<b>14</b> But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, [you are] blessed. 
    "And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled."
    <b>15</b> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, 
    and always [be] ready to [give] a defense 
        to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, 
        with meekness and fear;
        <b>16</b> having a good conscience, 
        that when they defame you as evildoers, 
            those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.
    <b>17</b> For [it is] better, 
        if it is the will of God, 
        to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
<b>18</b> For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust,
    that He might bring us to God, 
    being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,
        <b>19</b> by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,
            <b>20</b> who formerly were disobedient, 
            when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while [the] ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
    <b>21</b> There is also an antitype which now saves us--baptism 
        (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, 
            but the answer of a good conscience toward God), 
        through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
            <b>22</b> who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, 
                angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.
<b>CH4</b> Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, 
    arm yourselves also with the same mind, 
    for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
        <b>2</b> that he no longer should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh for the lusts of men, 
            but for the will of God.
        <b>3</b> For we [have spent] enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles--
            when we walked in lewdness, 
                lusts,
                drunkenness,
                revelries,
                drinking parties,
                and abominable idolatries.
                <b>4</b> In regard to these, they think it strange that you do not run with [them] in the same flood of dissipation, 
                    speaking evil of [you].
                    <b>5</b> They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
<b>6</b> For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, 
    that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, 
    but live according to God in the spirit.
<b>7</b> But the end of all things is at hand; 
    therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers.
    <b>8</b> And above all things have fervent love for one another, 
        for "love will cover a multitude of sins."
        <b>9</b> [Be] hospitable to one another without grumbling.
        <b>10</b> As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, 
            as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
            <b>11</b> If anyone speaks, [let him speak] as the oracles of God. 
            If anyone ministers, [let him do it] as with the ability which God supplies, 
                that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, 
                    to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
<b>12</b> Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, 
      as though some strange thing happened to you;
      <b>13</b> but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ's sufferings, 
          that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.
    <b>14</b> If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed [are you], 
        for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. 
        On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified.
        <b>15</b> But let none of you suffer as a murderer, 
            a thief,
            an evildoer,
            or as a busybody in other people's matters.
        <b>16</b> Yet if [anyone suffers] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.
            <b>17</b> For the time [has come] for judgment to begin at the house of God; 
                and if [it begins] with us first, what will [be] the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?
                <b>18</b> Now "If the righteous one is scarcely saved, Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
                <b>19</b> Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls [to Him] in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.
<b>CH5</b> The elders who are among you I exhort, 
    I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, 
    and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed:
        <b>2</b> Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, 
            serving as overseers, 
            not by compulsion but willingly, 
            not for dishonest gain but eagerly;
                <b>3</b> nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, 
                but being examples to the flock;
                <b>4</b> and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.
<b>5</b> Likewise you younger people, 
    submit yourselves to your elders. 
        Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, 
        and be clothed with humility, 
        for "God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble."
            <b>6</b> Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,
                <b>7</b> casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.
                <b>8</b> Be sober, 
                be vigilant; 
                    because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
                        <b>9</b> Resist him, steadfast in the faith, 
                            knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.
<b>10</b> But may the God of all grace, 
    who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, 
    after you have suffered a while, 
        perfect,
        establish,
        strengthen,
        and settle [you].
    <b>11</b> To Him [be] the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
<b>12</b> By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, 
    exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
<b>13</b> She who is in Babylon, elect together with [you], greets you; and [so does] Mark my son.
<b>14</b> Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
