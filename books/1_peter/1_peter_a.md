## Application

* Conclusion of the matter 
  * Titus 2:11-14
    * The grace of God does teach us to live godly lives, it is in light of the coming hope! It is He that purifies us.
  * 2 Peter 3
    * Peter speaks of the reason for his epistles, that he would stir up by way of reminder the things pertaining to the coming of Christ
  * Acts 24:14-16
    * Paul because of hope in God, strives

* We are pilgrims because we look to another homeland - Heb 11:13-16
  * These all died in faith looking to the promises, pilgrims because rather then looking to the their country they desired a heavenly country!

* We rejoice in our living hope and bring glory to Christ
* They had not and did not see Christ, but they rejoiced! For they knew that when He is revealed we shall be made like Him! We will see Him face to face!
* 1Co 13:12, 15:50, 2Co 3:18

* It is not simply us being told to live holy
* It is not to exhort us to grit our teeth and be like Jesus was in suffering
* But to look to Him, our living hope! We must remember the purpose of the scripture story of redemption! It has never changed, from before and of old they looked to the coming of the Christ and now that He is revealed we look to His coming again.
* Submission is not suffering, it is beautiful, incorruptible and precious in the sight of God!

* Flee the wrath to come, flee to Jesus, just as in the days of Noah some were saved by entering the ark, so must we enter into Christ to escape the coming judgment.

* 1 The living hope to which they were born again is something they rejoiced in
  * _Being born again is to an inheritance that is eternal_
    * Are you born again?
    * Do you look forward to the return of Christ when you will see Him face to face?
    * Do you rejoice in this living hope?

* 2 They were tested by trials so that their faith could bring praise honor and glory to Christ
  * _This is at the revelation of Christ, the theme of this book being a future hope it is significant that he points to Christ's return_
    * When your faith is tested by trials it can bring praise honor and glory to Him
    * Do we consider trials bad rather then good?

* 3 Those who have faith in Christ, believe, love, and rejoice in Christ even though they do not see Him
  * _Rejoicing starts now, because of belief that Christ will return and we will see Him_
    * Do we have inexpressible joy in Christ?
    * Do we believe and love Him even though we do not see?

      * connecting physical to the spiritual, with consequences

* 2:12
  * having conduct honorable is in contrast to earthly lust, or in alignment with abstaining from such
    * Gentiles here is referring to unbelievers, the word while in the past referred to non-jews it is now used for non-christians
  * _when_ they speak against you - in other words, they will
  * outsiders can observe their good works
    * a good work should cause them to glorify God - _Matthew 5:16_

* 2:13
  * in light of glorifying God with good works and obstaining from worldy behavior _THEREFORE~_
  * submit to _every_ ordinance of man

* 2:14
  * those in authority are sent by God
    * for the punishment of evildoers
    * for the praise of those who do good

* 2:15
  * it is the will of God 
    * that they do good 
    * that they may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men

* 2:16
  * they are to do good as those who are free
  * liberty is not to be a excuse for sin
    * _Gal 5:13_ 
    * _2Pe 2:19_
