## 1 Peter Observations

* The book was written not long after Paul's death
  * likely around the time of Nero - 64

### 1:1

* The book is from the Apostle Peter
  * it is likely Peter used an amanuensis - _5:12_
    * it has been argued that 5:12 could only be referring to Silvanus as the deliverer of the epistle
* Peter was the apostle to the Jews - _Galatians 2:7-8_
* Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia were among the regions spoken to at Pentecost - _Acts 2:9_
  * Aquila was born in Pontus - _Acts 18:2_
* Paul was withheld from going to Asia and Bithynia after going through the region of Galatia - _Acts 16:6-7_
  * The regions were reached directly or indirectly via the ministry of Paul
* Asia is made up of Jews and Greeks - _Acts 18:2-4, 19:10_
  * The gospel spread throughout Asia while Paul reasoned daily in the school of Tyrannus
    * This could be the result of people coming to him or believer's going out from there or both
* The regions being written to consisted of Gentiles and Jews
* Everyone in Asia turned away from Paul - _2 Timothy 1:15_

### 1:2

* the elect God knew of beforehand
* they were elect by the sanctification of the Spirit
* it was for obedience to Christ that they were sanctified
* and to be sprinkled with His blood
* it is possible that peace be multiplied; obtained more; be had in greater measure

### 1:3

* it is according to God's mercy that they have been born again
  * to a living hope
* access to living hope is through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
  * Jesus Christ was resurected from the dead
* Peter includes himself as having the living hope via the pronouns "our" and "us"

### 1:4

* there is an inheritance reserved in heaven
  * it is incorruptible
  * it is undefiled
  * does not fade away
  * it is for the elect
* reserved in heaven means it will be obtained in the future

### 1:5

* they are kept for salvation
  * through faith
  * by the power of God
* salvation will be revealed in the last time
  * there is something in the future they will be saved from
* the reference to last time is significant, this topic is mentioned often throughout the book

### 1:6

* they greatly rejoice in this living hope
* they rejoice even in trials because of this hope
* the trials are for a little while
* there is a possibility they are not needed
* the trials grieve them

### 1:7

* Faith is more precious then gold
* both faith and gold are tested by fire
* the purpose of their trials was to prove the genuiness of their faith 
  * and thus bring praise, honor and glory to Jesus
    * when Jesus Christ returns
      * this is a future event
* at the revelation of Jesus is related to the last time mentioned previously

### 1:8

* the pilgrims had not previously or currently seen Jesus
  * yet they love
  * yet they believe
    * and so rejoice
* past tense "not seen", yet they love
* present tense "do not see", yet they believe
  * they have not seen Him yet, but they will see Him in the last time when He is revealed
* Their joy is inexpressible
* Their joy is full of glory

### 1:9

* The outcome of faith is salvation
  * The salvation of their souls
* This is at the end of their faith, when they see Him as He is - _Heb 11:1, Rom 8:24-25_


### 1:10

* The prophets searched and inquired about this salvation
  * specifically seeking to know the person or time of what was predicted by the spirit - _1:11_
* The prophets prophesied of grace that would come

### 1:11

* The spirit of Christ was in the prophets
* the spirit testified of Christ beforehand
  * of his suffering 
  * and of glories to follow - _Rom 8:18_
  * The prophets did not know when these things would take place

### 1:12

* Peter again refers to "us" instead of "you"
  * NASB uses the word "you"
* the gospel was preached by the Holy Spirit
  * The Spirit was sent from heaven
* Angels desire to look into these things
  * see also Ephesians 3:12 and 1 Corinthians 11:10

### 1:13

* NKJV be sober / NASB be sober _in spirit_
* their hope should be fixed to something
  * on the grace to be brought to them
    * it will be brought at the revelation of Jesus Christ
* in concluding the gospel was preached to them they are to rest their hope on the grace that is to come in the last time

### 1:14-16

* They had former lusts
  * they were theirs in their ignorance
  * they are not to be conformed to them
    * being former and commanded not to conform to them implies they can go back to them
* in contrast to lust, they are to be holy
  * like the One who called them
  * they are to be so in all behavior/conduct
  * the reason is because it is written to be so - _Leviticus 11:44-5_

### 1:17

* the Father judges according to works
  * if they call on Him they ought to fear
    * during time on earth
* judgement will take place in last time - _1Pe 4:5, 2Ti 4:1_
* The reference to time here on earth is contrasted with not being redeemed with corruptible things
  * Time on earth is finite, something that is incorruptible lasts beyond
* their previous conduct was futile/aimless, in other words, it is not incorruptible
  * it had no hope

### 1:18-19

* they were redeemed with blood
  * not with silver and gold
* their previous way of life was futile/aimless

### 1:20

* Jesus was foreknown
* Jesus appeared in the last times
  * the last times are at hand
  * He appeared for their sake

### 1:21

* God raised Christ from the dead
  * and gave Him glory
  * it was for the purpose that their faith and hope would be in God
    * hope is a recurring theme of this book

### 1:22

* they have purified their souls in obeying the truth
* Peter commands them to love one another
  * This is done even though they have been purified for this purpose
  * he says to do so fervently

### 1:23

* being born again is not of corruptible seed
  * It is through the word of God - _Mark 4_
* The word of God lives and abides forever
* continued focus on incorruptibility, hope

### 1:24

### 1:25-2:3

* This word was preached to them
  * Peter appeals to this in saying _therefore laying aside..._ 
* the word is something to be desired
  * desiring the word and laying aside the listed actions should both be the result of recognizing that through it they were born again and that it endures forever.
* the purpose of the result is that they may grow
  * this is conditional on the reality that they have tasted that the Lord is gracious
    * this word preached testifies to the graciousness of God

### 2:1

### 2:2-3

* the word is compared to milk
* they are told to desire it as babes
  * for the purpose that they would grow
* tasting of the word is related to tasting of the graciousness of God
  * Peter says to taste of the word if indeed they have tasted of this graciousness

### 2:4

* Jesus was rejected by men
* Jesus is chosen and precious to God

### 2:5

* They are living stones
  * being built up
    * a spiritual house
    * a holy priesthood
* They can offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God
  * Through Jesus Christ
  * This is the reason they are being built up
* God will dwell with His people, they are the tabernacle of God - _1Co 3:16, Revelation 21:3_

### 2:6-8

* This is also contained in the scripture Isaiah 28:16
* Whoever believes on this chief cornerstone, will by no means be put to shame
  * Therefore He is precious to those who believe
  * To those who are disobedient He has become a stone of stumbling

### 2:9

* There is a list of descriptors for the chosen of God
* They are His own special people for the purpose that they may proclaim the praises of Him
* There is a contrast of them being called out of darkness to light

### 2:10

* They were once not the people of God

### 2:11

* Peter moves from describing the people of God to appealing to them as pilgrims - _Heb 11:13-16_
* Peter is making an appeal based on the fact that they are pilgrims
  * this appeal is to obstain from fleshly lusts
  * this appeal uses strong language such as calling them "beloved" and "begs them"
* Fleshly lusts war against the soul
  * obstaining from lust is a form of spiritual warfare

### 2:12

* the day of visitation is the coming judgment of God
  * visitation/inspection/judgement
* Gentiles in this book appear to be referring to unbelievers rather then non-jews
  * The word "Greeks" and "Gentiles" were once used to refer to "non-jews"  
  * There is no longer Jew and Greek - _Rom 10:12, Gal 3:28, Col 3:11. 1Co 12:13_
  * Some were once Gentiles - _Eph 2:11, 1Co 12:2, Gal 2:15_
    * It seems that the term Gentile was adopted to mean non-christian, or as Paul puts it, some once being "Gentiles in the flesh" would imply they would not be Gentiles any longer, spiritually. 
    * In Galatians Paul refers to him and Peter as Jews "by nature"

### 2:13-15

* Submission to authority is important
  * The centurion understood being under authority and he was attributed as being of of great faith _Matt 8, Luke 7_
* It is good be in submission to every ordinance of man
  * For the Lord's sake
* It is the will of God to put to silence the ignorance of foolish men

### 2:19

* For it to be commendable to suffer is similar to what is mentioned in 1:6-7

### 2:23

* Jesus committed Himself to Him who judges
  * God will judge the living and the dead - _1:17, 3:5_
    * this judgement would take place later

### 3:1

* submission to husbands is included in "every ordinance of man"
* a possible outcome of observing their good conduct is the husband might be won
  * this relates back to putting to silence the ignorance of foolish men - _2:15_

### 3:3-6

* the hidden person of the heart is in contrast to outward adornment
  * incorruptible beauty is a gentle and quiet spirit
  * incorruptible beauty is very precious to God
* Peter further compares this incorruptible beauty to submission
  * Woomen of God adorned themselves with submission to their husband
* wives are daughters of Abraham if they do good and are not afraid

### 3:7

* Husbands are to dweel with their wives with understanding in order that their prayers may not be hindered
* the wife is a weaker vessel

### 3:15

* The Lord is to be sanctified in their hearts
  * consecrated, treated as holy - _Lev 10:3, 20:7-8, 22:32, Isa 5:16, 8:13_

### 4:1

* Christ suffered in the flesh
  * it was for us
  * they are to have the same mind as Christ
    * In regards to suffering
