### NKJV

<pre>
    <b>CH1</b> James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
    To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings.
<b>2</b> My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
    <b>3</b> knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
        <b>4</b> But let patience have [its] perfect work, 
            that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
    <b>5</b> If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, 
        and it will be given to him.
        <b>6</b> But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, 
            for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.
            <b>7</b> For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
            <b>8</b> [he is] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
    <b>9</b> Let the lowly brother 
        glory in his exaltation,
    <b>10</b> but the rich 
        in his humiliation, 
            because as a flower of the field he will pass away.
            <b>11</b> For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; 
                its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. 
                So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.
    <b>12</b> Blessed [is] the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, 
        he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
        <b>13</b> Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; 
            for God cannot be tempted by evil, 
                nor does He Himself tempt anyone.
                <b>14</b> But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.
                    <b>15</b> Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; 
                        and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.
        <b>16</b> Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
    <b>17</b> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, 
        with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.
        <b>18</b> Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, 
            that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.
<b>19</b> So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;
        <b>20</b> for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
    <b>21</b> Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, 
        and receive with meekness the implanted word, 
            which is able to save your souls.
<b>22</b> But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
    <b>23</b> For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, 
        he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;
            <b>24</b> for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.
        <b>25</b> But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues [in it], 
        and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, 
            this one will be blessed in what he does.
<b>26</b> If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue 
    but deceives his own heart, 
    this one's religion [is] useless.
        <b>27</b> Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: 
            to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, 
            [and] to keep oneself unspotted from the world.


<b>CH2</b> My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with partiality.
        <b>2</b> For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes,
        <b>3</b> and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, "You sit here in a good place," and say to the poor man, "You stand there," or, "Sit here at my footstool,"
        <b>4</b> have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
        <b>5</b> Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world [to be] rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
        <b>6</b> But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?
        <b>7</b> Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called?
    <b>8</b> If you really fulfill [the] royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well;
            <b>9</b> but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
            <b>10</b> For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one [point], he is guilty of all.
            <b>11</b> For He who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
        <b>12</b> So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.
            <b>13</b> For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
    <b>14</b> What [does it] profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?
            <b>15</b> If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,
            <b>16</b> and one of you says to them, "Depart in peace, be warmed and filled," but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what [does it] profit?
            <b>17</b> Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
            <b>18</b> But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
            <b>19</b> You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe--and tremble!
        <b>20</b> But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?
            <b>21</b> Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
            <b>22</b> Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?
            <b>23</b> And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness." And he was called the friend of God.
        <b>24</b> You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.
            <b>25</b> Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent [them] out another way?
<b>26</b> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.


<b>CH3</b> My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.
        <b>2</b> For we all stumble in many things. 
    If anyone does not stumble in word, he [is] a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.
            <b>3</b> Indeed, we put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body.
            <b>4</b> Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires.
            <b>5</b> Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles!
        <b>6</b> And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity. 
    The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell.
        <b>7</b> For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.
        <b>8</b> But no man can tame the tongue. [It is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
        <b>9</b> With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God.
    <b>10</b> Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. 
My brethren, these things ought not to be so.
        <b>11</b> Does a spring send forth fresh [water] and bitter from the same opening?
        <b>12</b> Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh.
    <b>13</b> Who [is] wise and understanding among you? 
Let him show by good conduct [that] his works [are done] in the meekness of wisdom.
        <b>14</b> But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, 
    do not boast and lie against the truth.
        <b>15</b> This wisdom does not descend from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, demonic.
            <b>16</b> For where envy and self-seeking [exist], confusion and every evil thing [are] there.
    <b>17</b> But the wisdom that is from above is first 
        pure, 
        then peaceable, 
        gentle, 
        willing to yield, 
        full of mercy 
        and good fruits, 
        without partiality 
        and without hypocrisy.
    <b>18</b> Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
