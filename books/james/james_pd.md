    <b>CH1</b> James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings.
    <b>2</b> My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
    <b>3</b> knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
    <b>4</b> But let patience have [its] perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
    <b>5</b> If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
    <b>6</b> But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.
    <b>7</b> For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
    <b>8</b> [he is] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
    <b>9</b> Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation,
    <b>10</b> but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away.
    <b>11</b> For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.
    <b>12</b> Blessed [is] the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
    <b>13</b> Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.
    <b>14</b> But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.
    <b>15</b> Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.
    <b>16</b> Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
    <b>17</b> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.
    <b>18</b> Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.
    <b>19</b> So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;
    <b>20</b> for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
    <b>21</b> Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
    <b>22</b> But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
    <b>23</b> For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;
    <b>24</b> for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.
    <b>25</b> But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues [in it], and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.
    <b>26</b> If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one's religion [is] useless.
    <b>27</b> Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, [and] to keep oneself unspotted from the world.
