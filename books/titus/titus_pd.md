# Titus Propositional Diagram

### NKJV

<pre>
    <b>CH1</b> Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness,
    <b>2</b> in hope of eternal life 
        which God, 
            who cannot lie, 
            promised before time began,
        <b>3</b> but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, 
            which was committed to me 
                according to the commandment 
                    of God our Savior;
    <b>4</b> To Titus, a true son in [our] common faith: 
        Grace, mercy, [and] peace 
            from God the Father 
            and the Lord Jesus Christ 
                our Savior.
<b>5</b> For this reason I left you in Crete, 
    that you should set in order the things that are lacking, 
    and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you--
        <b>6</b> if a man is blameless, 
            the husband of one wife, 
            having faithful children not accused of dissipation 
            or insubordination.
                    <b>7</b> For a bishop must be blameless, 
                as a steward of God, 
                    not self-willed, 
                    not quick-tempered, 
                    not given to wine, 
                    not violent, 
                    not greedy for money,
                    <b>8</b> but hospitable, 
                    a lover of what is good, 
                    sober-minded, 
                    just, 
                    holy, 
                    self-controlled,
                    <b>9</b> holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, 
                        that he may be able, 
                            by sound doctrine,
                              both to exhort
                              and convict
                                  those who contradict.
<b>0</b> For there are many insubordinate,
    both idle talkers and deceivers,
        especially those of the circumcision,
    <b>1</b> whose mouths must be stopped,
      who subvert whole households,
      teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain.
    <b>2</b> One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans [are] always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
        <b>3</b> This testimony is true. 
            Therefore rebuke them sharply, 
                that they may be sound in the faith,
                <b>4</b> not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth.
    <b>5</b> To the pure all things are pure, 
but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; 
  but even their mind and conscience are defiled.
  <b>6</b> They profess to know God,
      but in works they deny [Him], 
          being abominable, 
          disobedient, 
          and disqualified 
              for every good work.
<b>CH2</b> But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine:
    <b>2</b> that the older men be sober, 
        reverent, 
        temperate, 
        sound in faith, 
        in love, 
        in patience;
    <b>3</b> the older women likewise, 
        that they be reverent in behavior, 
        not slanderers, 
        not given to much wine, 
        teachers of good things--
            <b>4</b> that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, 
            to love their children,
            <b>5</b> [to be] discreet, 
            chaste, 
            homemakers, 
            good, 
            obedient to their own husbands, 
                that the word of God may not be blasphemed.
    <b>6</b> Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded,
        <b>7</b> in all things showing yourself [to be] a pattern of good works; 
            in doctrine [showing] 
                integrity, 
                reverence, 
                incorruptibility,
                <b>8</b> sound speech that cannot be condemned, 
                    that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, 
                        having nothing evil to say of you.
    <b>9</b> [Exhort] bondservants 
        to be obedient to their own masters, 
        to be well pleasing in all [things], 
        not answering back,
        <b>10</b> not pilfering, 
        but showing all good fidelity, 
            that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
<b>11</b> For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
    <b>12</b> teaching us that, 
        denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, 
            we should live soberly, 
            righteously, 
            and godly 
            in the present age,
    <b>13</b> looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
        <b>14</b> who gave Himself for us, 
        that He might redeem us from every lawless deed 
        and purify for Himself [His] own special people, zealous for good works.
<b>15</b> Speak these things, 
    exhort, 
    and rebuke 
    with all authority. 
    Let no one despise you.
    <b>CH3</b> Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, 
        to obey, 
        to be ready for every good work,
        <b>2</b> to speak evil of no one, 
        to be peaceable, 
        gentle, 
        showing all humility to all men.
    <b>3</b> For we ourselves were also once foolish, 
        disobedient, 
        deceived, 
        serving various lusts and pleasures, 
        living in malice 
        and envy, 
        hateful 
        and hating one another.
    <b>4</b> But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,
        <b>5</b> not by works of righteousness which we have done, 
        but according to His mercy He saved us, 
            through the washing of regeneration 
            and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
                <b>6</b> whom He poured out on us abundantly 
                    through Jesus Christ our Savior,
                        <b>7</b> that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
        <b>8</b> This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, 
    that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. 
        These things are good and profitable to men.
        <b>9</b> But avoid foolish disputes, 
            genealogies, 
            contentions, 
            and strivings about the law; 
            for they are unprofitable and useless.
    <b>10</b> Reject a divisive man 
        after the first and second admonition,
        <b>11</b> knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, 
            being self-condemned.
        <b>12</b> When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, 
    be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, 
        for I have decided to spend the winter there.
    <b>13</b> Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with haste, 
        that they may lack nothing.
<b>14</b> And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works, 
    to [meet] urgent needs, 
    that they may not be unfruitful.
<b>15</b> All who [are] with me greet you. 
    Greet those who love us in the faith. 
    Grace [be] with you all. Amen.
