## Robert Murrey McCheyne

"Preached twice in Larbert, on the righteousness of God, Rom. 1:16. In the morning was more engaged in preparing the head than the heart. This has been frequently my error, and I have always felt the evil of it, especially in prayer. Reform it, then, O Lord." __MEMOIR OF THE REV. R. M. M'CHEYNE.__
