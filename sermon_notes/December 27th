# Windsor Christian Fellowship

## Details

- _Speaker_: Philip Hartman
- _Primary Passage_: Matthew 5 

## Application points made

What if we could be noticed as Christians because unlike the rest of the world we do not complain about 2020. We are light and declare the hope that is within us.

Let us proclaim His word and live boldly for the the Lord, not ashamed of the gospel.

Walk in the reality of being salt and light. Be watchful that we do not lose our salitness or hide the light. Remove impurity and doubt.

## Notable Observations

- Jude 

Salt that is not salty, has lost it's essential purpose. Clouds without rain, has no purpose. Trees without fuit, have not served their purpose. A Wandering star is used for guidence, so what use is it if it wonders.

- Luke 14:25-34, Mark 9:42-50

Salt acts as a preservative, it heals and cleanses.

- 1 John 1

We are light, as the moon reflects the sun, so we reflect the light of the Son.

It is natural to put a light where it can be seen, but it is not right to be hidden. It is natual for a Christian to shine forth Christ's light, but it is a perversion if we begin to hide or put out that light.

Light will always banish darkness, darkness cannot hold back light.

Light brings clarity and division. Dividing good and evil.

A single eye towards Christ is filled with light. But looking to anything else is evil and in darkness.
