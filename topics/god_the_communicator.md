### How does God reveal Himself?

God reveals Himself through General Revelation (Creation, Common Grace, Conscience) and Special Revelation (The Written and Incarnate Word)

#### General Revelation

Paul tells us in Romans that men who surpress the truth of God made evident in creation are without excuse. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen. We can also see this declaration in the Psalms when it speaks of God's glory in creation. 

  * Creation
    * Romans 1
    * Psalm 19
      * "1 To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork. 2 Day unto day utters speech, And night unto night reveals knowledge. 3 [There is] no speech nor language [Where] their voice is not heard. 4 Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun,"
    * Psalm 8
      * "3 When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained, 4 What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of man that You visit him?"
  * Common Grace
    * Matthew 5:45
      * 45 "that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
    * Acts 14:17
  * Conscience
    * Romans 2

#### Special Revelation

In Hebrews, it is said that spoke in time past through the prophets, and now speaks through His son. Jesus Him self says if we have seen Him we have seen the Father. John 1 reveals that Jesus was the word made flesh that dwelt among us. Paul writes to Timothy that the word is able to make him wise for salvation, and Peter tells us that we have all that we need for life and Godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue.

* Hebrews 1
* John 1
* 2 Timothy 3:14-17
* 2 Peter 1
