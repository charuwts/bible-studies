### Prayer

"Preached twice in Larbert, on the righteousness of God, Rom. 1:16. In the morning was more engaged in preparing the head than the heart. This has been frequently my error, and I have always felt the evil of it, especially in prayer. Reform it, then, O Lord." __MEMOIR OF THE REV. R. M. M'CHEYNE.__

## Isaac Watts

### Ideas

Let as many of your ideas as possible be the representation of things, and not merely the representation of other men's ideas : thus your soul, like some noble building, shall be richly furnished  with original paintings, and not with mere copies. __Logic, The Right Use Of Reason In The Inquiry After Truth, pg 71__

A clear and distinct idea is that which represents the object of the mind with full evidence and strength, and plainly distinguishes it from all other objects whatsoever. __Logic, The Right Use Of Reason In The Inquiry After Truth, pg 39__

### Preaching

It is as easy to paint fire with heat, as with pen and ink to commit that to paper which occurs in preaching. There is as much difference between a sermon in the pulpit, and printed in a book, as between milk in the warm breast, and in a sucking bottle, yet what it loseth in lively taste, is recompensed by the convenience of it. The book may be at hand when the preacher cannot; and truly, that is the chief end of printing, that as the bottle and spoon is used when the mother is sick or out of the way; so the book, to quiet the Christan and stay his stomach in the absence of the ordinance. __The Christian in Complete Armour, pg 2 -*Hendrickson Publishers, Fourth Printing June 2015*-__

### Christian Duty

An instrument is not in tune, except it have all the strings, and these will not make good music, if the musician hath not wisdom to cause every string to speak in it's due time. The Christian is not in tune, exceot he takes in all the duties of his place and calling, neither will the performance of them be harmonious in God's ear, if every one be not done in it's proper season. O my friends, labour not only to do the duty of your place, but that duty in it's own place also. __The Christian in Complete Armour, pg 2 -*Hendrickson Publishers, Fourth Printing June 2015*-__
