# The Mind

## Memory

### The memory strongly functions around "links" or what could be called "anchors"

For example, when in a conversation with a group, a statement or question is made which triggers a memory, or a thought based on a memory which they then say something about and this triggers another and so on. And if at any point something is said that doesn't trigger anything with the group a pause may occur until something is recalled or a new topic is introduced.

## Questions

### You will never think a thought that is not either a question, or an answer to a question

For example, if it's a statement like, "I am tired", the question could be "How do you feel?". Even if a thought is a single word, the question could be "what word are you thinking about?". Which is easily followed by another question, "what does that word mean?". Recognizing this establishes a rather significant fact, asking questions directs our thoughts and the thoughts of others. Therefore, becoming proficient in the use of questions is an invaluable tool in study and communication.
